    "revisedPrompt": "A summer scene unfolds on a sandy beach under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, several people of different genders and descents are working together to clean up the beach. A Caucasian woman is bending over to pick up a discarded plastic bottle, while a Hispanic man is scooping up wrappers with a long-handled net. Meanwhile, a South Asian girl is depositing a pile of collected rubbish into a large, recycling bin. Sea waves gently crash onto the shore, and seagulls fly overhead, their calls mixing with the sound of the ocean.",
