    "revisedPrompt": "Transform the sea into a protected park area, complete with walking trails and picnic spots, surrounded by marine life like dolphins, fishes and seagulls. Imagine the waves gently lapping against the shore, the smell of salt in the air, benches for visitors to rest and relax, trees providing shade, and signs instructing people to respect the environment and avoid littering. In the distance, a lighthouse stands as a beacon, guiding sea vessels away from the park boundaries.",
