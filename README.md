# Din Id√©
Project under development for danish aquarium Kattegatcentret.
Installation made in Unity3D, where users can write down inventions to help the danish ocean environments from pollution.
The user types in an idea, which is being processed by an "idea machine", and then appears on another screen as an image (illustrated using DALLE-3.)

Exhibition opens in spring 2024 in Kattegatcentret, Grenaa, Denmark.
